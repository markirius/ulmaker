# usb linux maker aka ulmaker ver. (yes... i won't reconize windows, but exists)

### How to ("comofas") it's a joke... ok
Right... but... how i run this thing? ("comofas... yes again")
```
python ulmaker <distro>
```

### If i made a mess...
If no distro or unsupported distro is entered as an argument, a help message will be displayed.

please... python 3, if the script won't run on your terminal, check your python version
```
python --version
```

### Pleaseeeeeee... listen...
If you don't trust on this script, disconnect all another usb (drives and key)... and run to the hills... no... but keep in mind... human errors occur, put only the drive you are going to use ("there's a selector, but human mind sometimes is a S###... hold a breath... it's a fact"), don't blame me if you loss important information.

Remember one more time, make a bootable usb, will erase all data on disk.

### No modules installed...
simple... :)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I hope this helps you.

really.


If you like or find any|more bugs/errors/stupid loops/anything, fell free to contact, fork, purge...
